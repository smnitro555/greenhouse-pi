# RF Keys Configuration for Greenhouse Devices
#
# This file contains the RF codes for controlling greenhouse appliances
# via 433MHz RF outlets. Update these codes based on your actual RF outlet codes.
#
# To find your RF codes, use the 'RFSniffer' utility from the rc-switch library
# or similar tools to capture the codes from your existing remotes.
#
# GPIO pins are for Raspberry Pi BCM numbering
